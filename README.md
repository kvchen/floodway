## About

##### Why _floodway_?

A floodway is defined by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floodway_(road)) as "a flood plain crossing for a road, built at or close to the natural ground level. They are designed to be submerged under water, but withstand such conditions." Similarly, this webapp was designed with a massive influx of CS students in mind - a situation which often overwhelms the available resources provided by the staff.
